# Changelog

All notable changes to this add-on are documented in this file.

## 3.0.1 (2026-06-20)

### 🧹 Config modernisation (clears Supervisor deprecation warnings)

- Remove `build.yaml`. Both supported architectures use the same base image,
  which is now declared by the `ARG BUILD_FROM` default in the `Dockerfile`,
  as required by current Supervisor (`build.yaml` is deprecated).
- Remove the deprecated `codenotary` field from `config.yaml` (Supervisor now
  ignores it).
- Point `config.yaml` `url` at this fork.

### 🐛 Fixes

- Fix recurring logrotate error `unknown group 'npm'`. The add-on runs its
  services as `root` and never creates the upstream `npm` user/group, but the
  logrotate config shipped by NPM declares `su npm npm`. Rewrite it to
  `su root root` during build (same approach already used for `nginx.conf`),
  so nginx access/error logs in `/data/logs` rotate instead of being skipped.

## 3.0.0 (2026-06-20)

### ⚠️ Breaking changes

- **Dropped `armv7` (32-bit ARM) support.** The Home Assistant base image
  no longer ships 32-bit builds from version 19 onward, so moving to a newer
  Alpine release means 32-bit ARM can no longer be built. Devices that need
  `armv7` must stay on the **2.x** series. Supported architectures are now
  `aarch64` and `amd64` only.

### ⬆️ Upgrades

- Upgrade base image `ghcr.io/hassio-addons/base` from `18.2.0` to `21.0.0`
  (Alpine 3.22 → 3.24).
- Upgrade **nginx** `1.28.0-r3` → `1.30.2-r1` (and `nginx-mod-stream` to match)
  — moves onto the current nginx **stable** branch.
- Upgrade **Node.js** `22.16.0-r2` → `24.16.0-r0`.
- Upgrade **npm** `11.3.0-r1` → `11.12.1-r0`.

- Upgrade **certbot** `4.0.0-r0` → `5.6.0-r0`.
- Upgrade **OpenSSL** `3.5.4-r0` → `3.5.7-r0` (`openssl` and `openssl-dev`).
